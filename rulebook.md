## 3 Schedule

`T+0` means the moment the contest starts. `T+90` means 90 minutes after that. The contest takes place on 6 October 2026; results are announced on 7 October 2026.

| Step | Time | What happens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Check-in** | Before setup | We check your ID and give you a lab PC. |
| **Setup** | 30 min (not part of contest time) | Log in to GitHub and your AI tools. Create a new public repository and confirm that you can push code. You will not see the problem yet. |
| **Contest starts** | T+0 | We share the problem, requirements and sample data. |
| **Questions** | T+0 to T+15 | You may ask the organizers questions about the problem. |
| **Build and deploy** | T+0 to T+90 | Build, test, commit, push and deploy your application. |
| **Deadline** | T+90 | Stop coding, committing, pushing and making deployment changes. Submit the official form by this time for an on-time submission. |
| **Late submission window** | After T+90, up to T+95 | You may submit the official form only. A 10-mark penalty applies. No code, Git repository or deployment changes are allowed during this period. |
| **Judging** | After submission | Judges evaluate the submitted repository, final eligible commit and required live deployment against the contest requirements. |
| **Results** | 7 October 2026 | Final results are published and winners are announced. |

*The organizers will announce the exact contest and results times separately.*

## 4 The Problem

- **4.1** You get the problem at T+0, on paper and/or on screen, with sample data and details of what your app should produce.
- **4.2** What we can tell you now: the app is frontend only (Section 5), useful for an organization, and works in both Bangla and English. External APIs are allowed, but participant-controlled persistent backend, database and online storage services are not.
- **4.3** You can ask the organizers questions only in the first 15 minutes. If the answer matters for everyone, we will tell everyone.
- **4.4** The problem has main tasks (must do) and bonus tasks (optional). Finish the main tasks first.

---

## 5 Technical Rules

- **5.1 Frontend only.** Your whole app must run in the web browser.
  - **Not allowed:** participant-controlled backend servers or server code, including serverless functions; persistent backend, database or online storage services controlled by the participant, including Firebase, Supabase or Appwrite used for that purpose.
  - **Allowed:** browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB), normal browser features, static website hosting, and external APIs under Section 5.4.
- **5.2 Any framework.** Use any framework you like, or none: plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, Svelte and so on. You can use open-source libraries from npm or a CDN. You can use official starter tools such as `create-vite` during the contest.
- **5.3 Start from zero.** All code must be written during the contest, by you or by AI. You cannot use code you wrote before, your own templates, old projects, or anyone else’s code. Start in a newly created repository. No organizer-provided template repository is supplied. Open-source libraries and official starter tools allowed by Section 5.2 remain permitted.
- **5.4 External APIs.** You can use external or public APIs if they use HTTPS and work directly from the browser (CORS). They must not serve as a participant-controlled persistent backend, database or online storage layer for your app. If an API stops working, the main parts of your app should still work.
- **5.5 AI inside your app (optional).** You can add AI features to your app, but the main features must work without AI. The user must type their own API key into the app. Never put an API key in your code, your repository or your live site.
- **5.6 Two languages.** Your app must work in both Bangla and English, for example with a language switch. All main labels, buttons, messages and instructions must be in both languages.
- **5.7 Required live website.** Deploy your app to a public HTTPS website by T+90. Judges must be able to open it in the latest Google Chrome without installing anything or signing in. The deployment must match your final eligible commit (Section 8.6). Include build and run commands in your README if applicable. See Section 10.
- **5.8 No secrets.** Never put passwords, tokens, API keys or login details in your repository, not even in old commits.

## 6 Using AI

- **6.1** You can use any AI tool, free or paid, and as many as you like.
- **6.2** Your AI accounts and usage limits are your responsibility. We do not provide AI subscriptions. You will not get extra time if your AI tool hits its limit or stops working.
- **6.3** AI coding agents can create files and run Git commands (commit, push) for you.
- **6.4** You are responsible for all the code you submit, even if AI wrote it. You must be able to explain how your app works when the judges ask.

---

## 7 Lab Rules

- **7.1** You may use the lab PC provided by the organizers or, optionally, your own laptop. Participants who choose to use their own laptop must bring their own backup internet connection. The organizers are not responsible for problems with a participant’s personal device.
- **7.2** You may use your phone for authentication and, when needed, as a backup internet hotspot. Do not use your phone for coding, AI tools, messaging, calls or other contest work.
- **7.3** You will have internet. Use it for AI tools, documentation, libraries, permitted external APIs and static hosting.
- **7.4** This is a solo contest. Do not talk to or message other participants or anyone outside: no chat apps, email, social media or remote access tools. Ask questions only to the organizers.
- **7.5** You can install tools and packages you need for your work. Do not turn off security software, open other people’s files, or disturb other PCs or the network.
- **7.6** When you finish, log out of all accounts (GitHub, AI tools, email) and close the browser. We will reset the lab PCs after the event. We are not responsible for accounts you leave logged in.
- **7.7** If an organizer-provided lab PC or internet connection has a problem, tell an organizer immediately. Extra time may be considered only for a verified problem with equipment or internet provided by the organizers. Problems with personal laptops or backup internet connections do not qualify for extra time.

## 8 GitHub Rules

- **8.1** During the 30-minute setup, create a new public repository named `devfest-<registration-number>`. No template repository is provided. You may add a README and MIT LICENSE during setup, but no project code.
- **8.2** Do not commit any project code before T+0.
- **8.3** Commit at least once every 30 minutes during the contest, with at least 3 commits in total. Judges will look at your commit history.
- **8.4** Every commit message must have a short note about what changed and the prompt you used to make that change. If you made the change yourself without AI, write “Manual edit”. Prompts can be in Bangla or English. Example:
  ```text
  Add language switch

  Prompt: "Add a toggle in the header that switches all labels
  between Bangla and English and remembers the choice."
  ```
- **8.5** Do not change your Git history: no force push, no rebasing pushed commits, no deleting the repository.
- **8.6** Your final eligible commit must be created and pushed by T+90. Judges will evaluate only that commit ID and its matching live deployment. Stop coding, committing, pushing and changing the deployment at T+90. The extra five minutes, after T+90 and up to T+95, are for submitting the form only and incur a 10-mark penalty. Commits created or pushed after T+90 are not eligible.

## 9 How to Submit

- **9.1** Submit using the official form by T+90 (late window: Section 9.4): *Will be Provided*. The form asks for:
  - your full name and registration number;
  - your repository link;
  - your final commit ID (full, or the first 7 characters);
  - your public HTTPS live website link (required), deployed using a service such as GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages. The link must be accessible to the judges without login or special permission.
- **9.2** Your repository must have:
  - all your source code;
  - `README.md`, containing the details in Section 9.3;
  - any output files the problem asks for;
  - a `LICENSE` file containing the MIT License.
- **9.3** Your README must include:
  - your name and registration number;
  - required public HTTPS live link;
  - how to run the app;
  - main features done;
  - bonus features;
  - known problems;
  - AI tools used;
  - your most useful prompt.
- **9.4** The on-time submission deadline is T+90. A submission received after T+90 and up to T+95 loses 10 marks. This is a submission-only window: your code, final eligible commit and live deployment must already be complete by T+90. After T+95, submissions are not accepted.
- **9.5** After submitting, do not change the submitted code, repository or deployment. In all cases, code, Git and deployment changes must stop by T+90, including for late submissions. Judges will check the submitted eligible commit and its matching deployment.

## 10 Putting Your App Online (Required)

- **10.1** You must deploy your app to a public HTTPS website by T+90. You may use a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel or Cloudflare Pages, subject to Section 5.1. Deployment is compulsory and earns no bonus marks.
- **10.2** Your required live link must:
  - open on the judge’s own device without login or installation;
  - run the main features of your app;
  - match your final eligible commit, created and pushed by T+90, with no deployment changes after T+90;
  - use HTTPS.
- **10.3** Your live site must not contain API keys or other secrets. Keep it available through the completion of judging and the publication of results.
